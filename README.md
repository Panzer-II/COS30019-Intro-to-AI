## Assignment 2 â€“ Inference Engine for Propositional Logic

* This is a collaboration project between:  
Huu Ti Dang (104101363)  
Lachlan Stanbrook (103071795)

* You need to implement an inference engine for propositional logic in software based on the Truth Table (TT)
checking, and Backward Chaining (BC) and Forward Chaining (FC) algorithms. Your inference engine will
take as arguments a Horn-form Knowledge Base KB and a query q which is a proposition symbol and
determine whether q can be entailed from KB. You will also need to write a report about how your program
works with different knowledge bases and queries.
